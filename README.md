# Sandstorm Detection on Mars

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting sand/dustorms on the Martian surface in order to more effectively pinpoint the best locations for potential human colonization.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

- **Viraj Das**: Project lead and model architect. Responsible for designing the detection pipeline and integrating real-time data capture.
- **Aman**: Data engineer. In charge of preprocessing the dataset, managing data pipelines, and ensuring data quality.
- **Adithi**: Research and evaluation. Focused on comparing model performance between TensorFlow and YOLO, and optimizing hyperparameters.
- **Ryan**: Deployment and visualization. Handles real-time inference, alert mechanisms, and building the user interface for monitoring.
