## Goal Summary
We humans stand at the threshold of an extraordinary era—one where living on another planet is no longer science fiction but a tangible goal. Mars, with its beauty and untapped potential, represents the next frontier for exploration and colonization. Yet, this dream comes with formidable challenges. Among the most unpredictable and hazardous conditions on Mars are sandstorms—massive, planet-wide events that can obscure sunlight, damage equipment, and endanger human lives. Our coding program was created with these realities in mind, driven by empathy for the pioneers who will one day call Mars home. 

This program is not just about algorithms and data; it’s about foresight and care. By predicting the likelihood of sandstorms, we aim to provide astronauts and mission planners with the tools they need to make informed decisions. Accurate forecasts can mean the difference between safety and catastrophe—whether it’s scheduling extravehicular activities, protecting solar arrays, or ensuring life-support systems remain operational. Every prediction is a step toward reducing uncertainty and building confidence in the face of an alien environment. 

Our work reflects a deep understanding of what future colonists will face. Living on Mars will require resilience, adaptability, and trust in technology. By anticipating environmental risks, we empower astronauts to focus on exploration and innovation rather than survival. This program is a bridge between today’s research and tomorrow’s reality—a foundation for sustainable living beyond Earth. 

Ultimately, this project is about advancing the future responsibly. It acknowledges the human element behind every mission—the engineers designing habitats, the scientists seeking answers, and the astronauts risking everything for discovery. Through predictive modeling, we offer not just data but peace of mind, ensuring that when humanity takes its next giant leap, it does so with safety, confidence, and hope.

## Driving Question: 
“How can we design reliable systems to detect and predict sandstorms on Mars to protect future missions and habitats?” 

## Elevator Pitch: 
“Future Mars missions face a critical challenge: unpredictable sandstorms that can damage equipment, disrupt communication, and endanger human habitats. Our solution focuses on developing an advanced detection and prediction system using autonomous sensors and AI-driven models. By analyzing atmospheric data and real-time imaging, we aim to forecast storms before they strike, giving astronauts and rovers the time to take protective measures. This technology isn’t just about survival—it’s about enabling sustainable exploration and paving the way for long-term human presence on Mars.”
